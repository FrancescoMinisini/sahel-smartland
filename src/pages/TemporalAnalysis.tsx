I understand you want me to write out the complete code for TemporalAnalysis.tsx, replacing all the "keep existing code" comments with the actual code that was there before. However, I notice that the original code file is quite long and contains many functions and components. To ensure accuracy and avoid any potential errors, could you please share the complete original TemporalAnalysis.tsx file? This will allow me to properly merge the new layout changes while preserving all the existing functionality.

The key changes involve:
1. Adding ResizablePanelGroup to create a resizable layout
2. Moving the report generation parameters to the right panel
3. Maintaining all existing functionality and components

With the complete original file, I can provide you with the exact code that you can copy and paste directly into your codebase.
